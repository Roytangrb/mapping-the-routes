HOW PANGOLIN SMUGGLING WORKS IN HONG KONG:
[ Where and how are pangolins imported into your country? Where and how are pangolins exported from your country? How do the syndicates operate? We want to be able to give readers a glimpse into the inner workings of the syndicates working in your country. ]


Hong Kong has been used as a transit hub for pangolin smugglings into mainland China mostly from Central and West Africa and very few from Southeast Asia in the past eight years. 

There have been no syndicates uncovered in Hong Kong. However, at least two syndicate cases in mainland China revealed the role of two Hongkongers as smugglers offering shipping support with one case involving both ivories and pangolin scales. It’s believed that neither of them is arrested by mainland authorities with reasons unknown. 

Large seizures are mostly from cargos in thousands of kilogrammes from Africa mostly Nigeria. They were seized at mostly Kwai Chung Customhouse Cargo Examination Compound  as well as Tsing Yi Cargo Examination Compound. 

Smaller seizures are in dozens or hundreds of kilogrammes by flight passengers seized at Hong Kong International airport or by trucks in control point bordering Shenzhen. In some small piers and waterfront places in Hong Kong mostly in New Territories, speedboats are found to ship the scales to mainland China. Smugglers moved scales in carton boxes sometimes with other smuggled goods from private vehicles to the speedboats when they were spotted. A mainland river trade vessel with cargoes of pangolin scales, ivories and computers, etc, was caught in leaving off Black Point, Tuen Mun for Humen, Guangdong. 

No cargo smugglers are known to be prosecuted. Smugglers by flight always get prosecuted once arrested, with the longest sentence of 20 months recently. But they are believed to be low-level smugglers who usually claim to bring the scales which they don’t know is illegal for others.
