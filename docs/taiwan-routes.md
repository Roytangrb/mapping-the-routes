HOW PANGOLIN SMUGGLING WORKS IN TAIWAN:
[ Where and how are pangolins imported into your country? Where and how are pangolins exported from your country? How do the syndicates operate? We want to be able to give readers a glimpse into the inner workings of the syndicates working in your country. ]

Taiwan used to legally export pangolins from the 1950s to the 1970s. It was not until 1989, that the government established the Wildlife Conservation Act, commercial harvesting and export was banned.

Most of prosecution cases in Taiwan are mostly related to domestic trade. Taiwan’s current role in smuggling is not as important as in other Asian countries. However, due to geographic location between China and Taiwan, Taiwan can still be one of the smuggling transit spot for China 

In 2018, Kaohsiung customs officials intercepted 3,880 descaled and disemboweled Sunda pangolin bodies in a container that originated from Malaysia. We believe there is a great possibility that these pangolins are destined to smuggle into China. 

In 2015, the Coast Guard Administration seized five Taiwan pangolins that were about to be smuggled to China, along with Asian yellow pond turtles and yellow-margined box turtles. We assume that pangolins may be smuggling along with other animals into China.

Malaysia-Taiwan-China（cargo by sea）: 3,880 descaled and disemboweled Sunda pangolin bodies are found by Taiwan Kaohsiung customs.The customs said these pangolins were from Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, and the departure date was Dec 27, 2017. 
Because the prosecutor still investigates the case, we can't get further information about the sender and receiver.
