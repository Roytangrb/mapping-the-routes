HOW PANGOLIN SMUGGLING WORKS IN MALAYSIA:
[ Where and how are pangolins imported into your country? Where and how are pangolins exported from your country? How do the syndicates operate? We want to be able to give readers a glimpse into the inner workings of the syndicates working in your country. ]
In Peninsular Malaysia, pangolins are sourced from Indonesia across the Melaka straits, as well as locally, through indigenous poachers. In Peninsular Malaysia, they are exported over land, via the Thai border, then on to Laos or China. In Malaysia, there does not appear to be one large smuggling syndicate controlling the trade. It operates more like an open market. Pangolins sourced locally or from neighbouring Indonesia are sold to the highest bidder. These buyers are often in competition with one another, to the point of snitching on each other to the authorities. They then engage smugglers to bring it across the border to Thailand. Smuggling in Peninsular Malaysia is often facilitated by police officers, specifically from one particular police station. Pangolins are usually exported live.
In East Malaysia (Borneo), pangolins are sourced locally or from neighbouring Kalimantan. They are brought to Sabah, where they are processed and frozen. They are then exported via shipping containers, often through Sepanggar Port in Kota Kinabalu. In East Malaysia, the size of the seizures indicates that there could be a larger syndicate that is controlling the trade.

Key locations along smuggling route: (these locations are important to help us create a smuggling route map)
 - Shoreline along Melaka straits, where pangolins often arrive from Indonesia on boats.
 - Central forest spine of Peninsular Malaysia, source of pangolins in Peninsular Malaysia [it is the central forested area of Peninsular Malaysia]
 - Changlun, Kedah https://goo.gl/maps/2zPRgWJSgSe4XmAU8 -- A border town where pangolins are often sent to, and passed to smugglers to bring across the Thai border.

 - Bukit Kayu Hitam https://goo.gl/maps/Gtmds7s6Wmafn2W59 -- Border crossing where smuggling often takes place.
 - Thai smugglers then transport the pangolins to Laos
